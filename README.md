# Peer-to-peer-network

#Introduction:

Peer to peer network, commonly known as P2P is a decentralized network communications
model that consists of a group of devices (nodes) that collectively store and share files
where each node acts as an individual peer. In this network, 
P2P communication is done without any central administration or server,
which means all nodes have equal power and perform the same tasks.

#Why P2P Network is important in blockchain:

The P2P network is the key to making
blockchain work. In cryptocurrency the P2P network can help prevents the
double spending issue for PoW and is also the core architecture behind
PoS. In a blockchain, it allows you to sync any data needed on a network.

#Steps
1. Clone the repository and load code into editor
2. Run "nmp install"
3. Run "node p2p.js"
